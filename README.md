### Description

My dedicated [i3WM](https://i3wm.org) configurations.

I've used and added to this setup for many years. It's a clean and minimalistic approach to window management, without the hand-holding of the default configuration. Contrary to typical i3WM setups, I've used no bars, no indicators, and no modes for a long time.

Included, are several handy scripts for i3(-gaps):

  * **comp_toggle** - _Easily toggle compton/picom on or off._
  * **font_cycle** - _Cycle between multiple pre-set alacritty(1) fonts._
  * **key_autorepeat** - _Toggle keyboard autorepeat \- challenge your Vim!_
  * **lockscreen** - _Simple but presentable lockscreen helper for i3lock(1)_
  * **partmount** - _Easily toggle-mount filesystems with udisksctl(1)_
  * **shooter** - _Easily take screen-, window-, or select-shots with scrot(1)_
  * **term_font_size** - _Globally adjust alacritty(1) or xfce4-terminal(1) font sizes_

Also included are several scripts for PulseAudio users.

Check out my i3WM programs [csi3](https://github.com/terminalforlife/Extra/blob/master/source/csi3), [i3-workspaces](https://github.com/terminalforlife/PerlProjects/blob/master/source/i3-workspaces), and [i3-active](https://github.com/terminalforlife/PerlProjects/blob/master/source/i3-active).
